I am very excited about my upcomming talk at the Checmk Conference #10 in Munich, Germany. 

In March 2024 I was accepted to give a talk at the conference. The topic am going to present is the world of Checkmk when you are an managed service provider. What features to the Checkmk Managed Edition bring to us as MSP's, what does it not do, and how do we work with it?

I will try and give an insight to some of the pitfalls you might encounter when working with customers in mixed environments, the security aspects of it. 

This also gave me an excuse to finally get starting with this page/blog. I will create guides and designs for Checkmk in what I believe to be a more integrated and secure setup than most of the installations I have seen over the years. But more on that later, now I need to focus on getting my presentation ready for the conference.
