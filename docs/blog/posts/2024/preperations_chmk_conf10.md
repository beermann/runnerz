So it's friday, and on wednesday I am going to give my talk. I am not ready yet but the slides are stating to look like something I feel comfortable with. 

I need to have a list to make sure I do not forget anything important.

- [ ] Publish the site before the conference
    * [x] Initial config of MKdocs
    * [x] Create Github repo to host the site
    * [ ] Create Github Action to publish site
- [ ] Presentation
    * [ ] Run it by a coworker
    * [ ] Check for spelling errors
    * [ ] Dry run at the conference center, monday afternoon.
- [x] Passport
- [x] Travel documents
- [x] Laptop
- [ ] Put cool stickers on laptop

I am sure I am going to forget something.
