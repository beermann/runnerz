Arrived at Munchen today, and went to Paulaner am Nockherberg where the conference is held. 
Everyone giving a talk at the conferense had to check-in for a mic check and get af felling of the conference system used.

This also gave me the oppotunity to figure out the best route from the Hotel to the conference.
This year the hotel of choice was [gambino Hotel WERKSVIERTEL](https://gambinohotelwerksviertel.com/index.php/en/) only a short walk from the S-Bahn, really nice hotel clean and with a very nice streetfood area next door, and a feature I have never seen before but would hope more hotels would copy ;)

Looking forward to tomorrow.
